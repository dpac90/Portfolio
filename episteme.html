						<h3>Problem Summary</h3>
						<p>There was an increasing need for better collaboration among one of the company's largest departments with 30,000+ employees and counting. Business Analysts discovered that even though Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) were at large, it was getting increasingly difficult to identify and reach them for advice on client-specific requirements and to obtain training.
						<br><br>
						A web-based forum existed that aimed to solve this problem by connecting SMEs with the people that needed help on client-specific requirements. However, the forum's adoption rate was low due to poor User Experience (UX).</p>

						<h3>Goal</h3>
						<p>The primary goal was to revamp and improve the UX of the existing web-based forum, while adding features that would attract users, increase interaction among the users, and retain them.
						<br><br>
						The business goal on the other hand, was to ultimately enable employees to cater to the needs of their clients in the best way possible. Episteme was poised to serve this goal through increased collaboration.</p>

						<h3>Vision</h3>
						<p>Episteme was envisioned as a platform that would enable employees to connect, collaborate and contribute. This project focuses on the web-based portal, which is only a part of that vision, that would have the following features:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Forum</strong> - A place for people to ask questions directly to SMEs</li>
							<li><strong>Store</strong> - A platform to showcase in-house tools and products</li>
							<li><strong>Tech Talk</strong> - A repository and showcase of conferences and knowledge sharing sessions conducted by employees</li>
							<li><strong>Periodiko</strong> - A magazine format blog for thought-leaders to share their ideas</li>
							<li><strong>Engage</strong> - A platform to manage interactions with real clients</li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						<h3>Approach</h3>
						<blockquote>"Itâ€™s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works" - Steve Jobs, The Guts of a New Machine, 2003</blockquote>
						<p>To build a better system that served its users well, I had to understand the technology being used; front-end as well as back-end. The existing web forum was created using C# and the .NET framework, and had a very dated UI that utilized HTML tables for the layout. The technology used also did not allow flexibility for content changes and quick UI improvements. To allow for better content management, a complete overhaul of the system architecture was needed, while keeping in mind that all the existing data would have to be ported to the new system. The UI also needed to be modern and responsive, so employees can connect and collaborate using multiple devices.
						<br><br>
						After much consideration, the Project Manager and I decided to go with WordPress as our Content Management System (CMS) of choice. We recognized early on that we would have to make a lot of customizations to the WordPress back-end as well as create a custom theme in order to realize the Episteme vision. With this in mind, we started recruiting team members for the project.</p>

						<h3>Team</h3>
						<p>The team initially consisted of 1 designer (me), 1 developer, 1 project manager, 1 director and the stakeholder. Eventually we recruited more people and it grew to:
						<div class="row work-process">
							<div class="2u 4u(small) align-center">
								<h2 class="icon fa-users"></h2>
								<p>2 Designers</p>
							</div>
							<div class="2u 4u(small) align-center">
								<h2 class="icon fa-users"></h2>
								<p>2 Front-end Developers</p>
							</div>
							<div class="2u 4u(small) align-center">
								<h2 class="icon fa-users"></h2>
								<p>4 WordPress Developers</p>
							</div>
							<div class="2u 4u(small) align-center">
								<h2 class="icon fa-user"></h2>
								<p>1 Project Manager</p>
							</div>
							<div class="2u 4u(small) align-center">
								<h2 class="icon fa-user"></h2>
								<p>1 Director</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						There was also a challenge for collaboration within the team (which is ironic as we were creating a portal to improve collaboration). We all were located in different offices at Hyderabad, Pune and Chennai. However, we overcame this challenge by conducting regular conference calls, using IM and social messaging services, and occasionally visited each others' offices.
						</p>

						<h3>Process</h3>
						<p>I was involved in the project since its inception, and had the opportunity to make sizable contributions in multiple fields, while interacting with stakeholders and guiding the developers and designers. The key parts of the process where I played a part are the following:

						<p>The following are some early wireframes created using Microsoft PowerPoint with the help of an add-on called <a href="http://www.powermockup.com/" target="_blank">PowerMockup</a>. In a large corporate where Microsoft products were heavily used, PowerPoint was the best option to get feedback easily from managers and stakeholders.</p>

						<p>These initial versions had a lot of shortcomings. For example, the 'My Profile' link is on the left navigation bar, which is right above links to other modules of the portal. This could be potentially confusing to users. We iterated on the above wireframes multiple times during the Prototyping phase to fix these issues and improve navigation.</p>

						<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
						<p>Pen and paper, PowerMockup, yEd Graph Editor, Sublime Text, Adobe Photoshop, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Foundation Zurb, WordPress, Internet Information Services (IIS), Github, Tortoise SVN, Redmine</p>

						<h3>Result</h3>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>User base increased by 600% within 3 months of launch</li>
							<li>Average user activity per week went up by 500% within 2 months of launch</li>
							<li>Improved exposure and client engagement opportunities for in-house products</li>
							<li>Improved knowledge sharing via employee blog posts and tech talks</li>
							<li>Improved client interaction management with centralized repository of client engagement records</li>
						</ul>
